# MathCalc
Aids with math. Provides useful Math functions, and helps students who are too lazy to do their work. Requires a basic understanding of math to use. This repo provides 3 versions(noUI, UI, Ti-basic). noUI is useful for building your own UI for the app, or using Algebra Helper's functions in another application while UI(main) is for general use. Mac and mobile versions are not planned at the moment.
