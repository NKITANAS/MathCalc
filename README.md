# MathCalc
Aids with math. Provides useful Math functions, and helps students who are too lazy to do their work. Requires a basic understanding of math to use. This repo provides 3 versions(noUI, UI, Ti-basic). noUI is useful for building your own UI for the app, or using Algebra Helper's functions in another application while UI(main) is for general use. The Ti-basic edition of MathCalc has less features due to the limits of the calculator, but it provides a fair version of the app for Ti-84 calculators. MathCalc has versions for Windows, Linux, and Ti-basic. Mac and mobile versions are not planned at the moment.
